# proxy.js
A fun little proxy thing I created at school :)


It will ask for a password.
Change it as you wish! 
( look under "</head>" for "var user1=" or "var pass1=" and change that as needed. )

Default user and pass =
User: dev

Pass: $**DEV@proxy.js!!11

also change the default title and favicon if you wish to mask it as something else :)
